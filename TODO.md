# TODO

- vbfin v2
  - rewrite to Engine - Algorithm - Operations
  - run() = optimize (create big table) + run
  - optimization
    - error on duplicates in one list
    - keep order of subgraphs based on indices of elements (add weights?)

- add simple broker simulation
- add summary statistics
- compare to known framework

- test RSI strategy
- test parameter optimization
- run parameter optimization

- run profiling
- find bottlenecks
- try compiling
- try separating calls: vectors / sequences
  - run vectors first over all data at once
  - run sequrnces after
- try optimizing

- find some weak/simple working strategy (ma, rsi)

- add tests?

- describe in article
- create ibkr or binance account
- setup bot

suggestions:

- performance test - graph table size/execution time
