# TODO

- add text/annotations as an alternative to legend
- vbfin v2
  - add example #2:
    - simple sequences
      - strategy
  - move examples to tools
  - add example #3
    - extended #2
    - functions to generate sequences for different symbols
    - SPX, BTC, F, TSLA, NVDIA

- can this data entry/data display be simplified?
  - config?
  - less/other parameters?

- add simple broker simulation
- add summary statistics
- compare to known framework

- test RSI strategy
- test parameter optimization
- run parameter optimization

- run profiling
- find bottlenecks
- try compiling
- try separating calls: vectors / sequences
  - run vectors first over all data at once
  - run sequrnces after
- try optimizing

- find decision making points, where market slows down to make a decision
  and either goes up or down
  - best place to enter/exit
- try different options for best entry/exist points
- try different strategies relative to such points

- calculate probabilities at different point in time for different moves
- try graphing a heatmap of probabilities (experiment with resolution) - where the price would end based on combination of triggered strategies
- multiplication of such heatmaps based on triggers

- find some weak/simple working strategy (ma, rsi)

- try market heatmap strategy

- add tests?

- describe in article
- create ibkr or binance account
- setup bot

suggestions:

- performance test - graph table size/execution time
