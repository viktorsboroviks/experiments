# TODO

- vbfin v2
  - add Sequence.name and return it on error

- add simple broker simulation
- add summary statistics
- compare to known framework

- test RSI strategy
- test parameter optimization
- run parameter optimization

- run profiling
- find bottlenecks
- try compiling
- try separating calls: vectors / sequences
  - run vectors first over all data at once
  - run sequrnces after
- try optimizing

- calculate probabilities at different pount in time for different moves
- try graphing a heatmap of probabilities (experiment with resolution) - where the price would end based on combination of triggered strategies
- multiplication of such heatmaps based on triggers

- find some weak/simple working strategy (ma, rsi)

- try market heatmap strategy

- add tests?

- describe in article
- create ibkr or binance account
- setup bot

suggestions:

- performance test - graph table size/execution time
